This is the Happy Golem Godot/Blender Utility Archive.

Everything here is open source (CC0), and released as is.

The only item currently in this package is a set of import/export plugins to convert a blender bezier curve to a godot path.
Only Bezier curves will be exported with blender, all others will be ignored. Godot plugin will import the path as it was created.
Tilts will be transferred with the path.
